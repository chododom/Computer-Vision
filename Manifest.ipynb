    "This is good.  If I recall correctly, some of these projects were done before taking this class?  Can you be sure to elaborate on this?  Also I would like your portfolio notebook to be a bit more descriptive and narrative: what were the main take-aways? What did you learn in the process of the project? What was the biggest challenge.\n",
